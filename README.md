## 🧭 Navigation Bar (Anchor Links)

The navigation bar at the top of the page contains links to three experiments:

### 🔹 Experiment 2.1 – Word Counter
This experiment demonstrates a **live word/character counter**.  
As the user types into the textarea, the counter updates in real time and restricts input after a defined limit.

**Concepts used:**
- `textarea` input handling
- JavaScript event listeners
- DOM manipulation

---

### 🔹 Experiment 2.2 – Product Filter
This experiment demonstrates a **dynamic product filtering system**.  
Users can filter products based on search input or category selection.

**Concepts used:**
- JavaScript array filtering
- Dynamic rendering of elements
- Input-based filtering logic

---

### 🔹 Experiment 2.3 – SVG Drawing Tool
This experiment demonstrates an **interactive SVG drawing application**.  
Users can draw free-hand lines using the mouse and erase drawings using an erase mode.

**Features include:**
- Free-hand drawing using SVG `<path>`
- Mouse event handling (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`)
- Draw and Erase modes
- Click-to-erase functionality

**Concepts used:**
- SVG manipulation
- Mouse event handling
- DOM and SVG APIs

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how multiple frontend experiments can be connected using anchor links while maintaining separate implementations. It also highlights practical debugging experience with deployment and navigation issues in real-world scenarios.
